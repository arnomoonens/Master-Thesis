\chapter*{Abstract}
Deep reinforcement learning allows for learning to perform a task using high-dimensional input such as images. However, it is sometimes necessary to learn variations of a task, for which certain knowledge can be transferred. In this thesis, we learn multiple variations of a task in parallel using both shared knowledge and task-specific knowledge. This knowledge is then transferred to a new task. In experiments, we saw that learning first on a set of source tasks significantly improves performance on a new task.

% the caption command provides the option to define a shorter entry displayed in the list of figures only whereas the text of the required argument will be displayed together with the figure. This applies for the list of table in the same way as it does for the list of figures.
