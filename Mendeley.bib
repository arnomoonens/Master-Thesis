@article{Jaderberg2016Reinforcement,
abstract = {Deep reinforcement learning agents have achieved state-of-the-art results by directly maximising cumulative reward. However, environments contain a much wider variety of possible training signals. In this paper, we introduce an agent that also maximises many other pseudo-reward functions simultaneously by reinforcement learning. All of these tasks share a common representation that, like unsupervised learning, continues to develop in the absence of extrinsic rewards. We also introduce a novel mechanism for focusing this representation upon extrinsic rewards, so that learning can rapidly adapt to the most relevant aspects of the actual task. Our agent significantly outperforms the previous state-of-the- art on Atari, averaging 880{\%} expert human performance, and a challenging suite of first-person, three-dimensional Labyrinth tasks leading to a mean speedup in learning of 10× and averaging 87{\%} expert human performance on Labyrinth.},

@article{Ammar2014,
abstract = {Transfer learning can improve the reinforcement learning of a new task by allowing the agent to reuse knowledge acquired from other source tasks. Despite their success, transfer learning methods rely on having relevant source tasks; transfer from inappropriate tasks can inhibit performance on the new task. For fully automonomous transfer, it is critial to have a method for automatically choosing relevant source tasks, which requires a similarity measure between Markov Decision Processes (MDPs). This issue has received little attention, and is therefore still a largely open problem. This paper presents a data-driven automated similarity measure for MDPs. This novel measure is a significant step toward autonomous reinforcement learning transfer, allowing agents to: (1) characterize when transfer will be useful and, (2) automatically select tasks to use for transfer. The proposed measure is based on the reconstruction error of a restricted Boltzmann machine that attempts to model the behavioral dynamics of the two MDPs being compared. Empirical results illustrate that this measure is correlated with the performance of transfer and therefore can be used to identify similar source tasks for transfer learning.},
