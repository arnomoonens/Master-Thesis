abstract = {Deep reinforcement learning agents have achieved state-of-the-art results by directly maximising cumulative reward. However, environments contain a much wider variety of possible training signals. In this paper, we introduce an agent that also maximises many other pseudo-reward functions simultaneously by reinforcement learning. All of these tasks share a common representation that, like unsupervised learning, continues to develop in the absence of extrinsic rewards. We also introduce a novel mechanism for focusing this representation upon extrinsic rewards, so that learning can rapidly adapt to the most relevant aspects of the actual task. Our agent significantly outperforms the previous state-of-the- art on Atari, averaging 880{\%} expert human performance, and a challenging suite of first-person, three-dimensional Labyrinth tasks leading to a mean speedup in learning of 10× and averaging 87{\%} expert human performance on Labyrinth.},

@article{Ammar2014,
abstract = {Transfer learning can improve the reinforcement learning of a new task by allowing the agent to reuse knowledge acquired from other source tasks. Despite their success, transfer learning methods rely on having relevant source tasks; transfer from inappropriate tasks can inhibit performance on the new task. For fully automonomous transfer, it is critial to have a method for automatically choosing relevant source tasks, which requires a similarity measure between Markov Decision Processes (MDPs). This issue has received little attention, and is therefore still a largely open problem. This paper presents a data-driven automated similarity measure for MDPs. This novel measure is a significant step toward autonomous reinforcement learning transfer, allowing agents to: (1) characterize when transfer will be useful and, (2) automatically select tasks to use for transfer. The proposed measure is based on the reconstruction error of a restricted Boltzmann machine that attempts to model the behavioral dynamics of the two MDPs being compared. Empirical results illustrate that this measure is correlated with the performance of transfer and therefore can be used to identify similar source tasks for transfer learning.},

    abstract = {Author Summary As every dog owner knows, animals repeat behaviors that earn them rewards. But what is the brain machinery that underlies this reward-based learning? Experimental research points to plasticity of the synaptic connections between neurons, with an important role played by the neuromodulator dopamine, but the exact way synaptic activity and neuromodulation interact during learning is not precisely understood. Here we propose a model explaining how reward signals might interplay with synaptic plasticity, and use the model to solve a simulated maze navigation task. Our model extends an idea from the theory of reinforcement learning: one group of neurons form an “actor,” responsible for choosing the direction of motion of the animal. Another group of neurons, the “critic,” whose role is to predict the rewards the actor will gain, uses the mismatch between actual and expected reward to teach the synapses feeding both groups. Our learning agent learns to reliably navigate its maze to find the reward. Remarkably, the synaptic learning rule that we derive from theoretical considerations is similar to previous rules based on experimental evidence.},
