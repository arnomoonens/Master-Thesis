\section{Artificial neural networks} % (fold)
\label{sec:artificial_neural_networks}
% What is it
Artificial neural networks are models that can approximate discrete-valued, real-valued and vector-valued functions.
They are composed of simple units that can be activated by other units and can further activate multiple other units using connections of varying strength.
%citation?
Artificial neural networks are loosely inspired by biological neural networks, where these units are called neurons, which are connected by axons.\\
The higher the strength, also called weight, between units, the more influence the unit has on the connected one. These strengths can be manually defined. However, thanks to a method called backpropagation, these weights can be learned systematically. The combination of artificial neural networks and backpropagation led to successful applications, for example to recognize handwritten characters \citep{journals/neco/LeCunBDHHHJ89}, for face recognition \citep{cottrell1990extracting} and to recognize spoken words \citep{journals/nn/LangWH90}. However, they were also used for reinforcement learning, for example to learn to balance a pendulum \citep{anderson:ieeecsm89} or play Backgammon \citep{Tesauro:92}.

\subsection{Basics} % (fold)
\label{sub:basics}
As said, artificial neural networks are made up of units. These units can be divided into layer, where the values of each layer are propagated to the next layer depending on connections with weights. These weights define the model. A simple artificial neural network is visualized in Figure~\ref{fig:ann}.
\begin{figure}[htb]

    \caption[An artificial neural network]{An artificial neural network with 3 input units, 4 hidden units and 2 output units. $w_{ih}$ and $w_{ho}$ are the weights for connections between respectively the input units and hidden units and between the hidden units and output units.}
    \label{fig:ann}
\end{figure}
Input units receive information that is available externally and provide information to other units. Output units are the opposite and receive information from the network itself and provide information externally. Hidden units both receive information from and provide information to units inside the network.\\
As a non-input unit gets weighted activations from multiple units, these need to be combined to determine if the unit can be activated or not. This is done by applying a linear or non-linear function to the weighted sum.

\subsection{Activation functions} % (fold)
\label{sub:activation_functions}
Formally, an activation function $\phi$ will compute for unit $j$ with inputs from layer $x$:
\begin{equation}
    o = \phi\big(\sum_i^n w_{ij} x_i\big)
\end{equation}
Or in vector format:
\begin{equation}
    o = \phi(\overrightarrow{w} \cdot \overrightarrow{x})
\end{equation}
Here, we will discuss the most commonly used activation functions.
\subsubsection{Perceptron} % (fold)
\label{ssub:perceptron}
A perceptron, defined by \cite{Rosenblatt58}, gives as output either $-1$ or $+1$:
\begin{equation}
e_t(s) = \begin{cases}
+1 & \text{if $\sum_i^n w_{ij} x_i > 0$}\\
-1 & \text{otherwise}
\end{cases}
\end{equation}
It can be seen as a hyperplane where the output is $-1$ or $+1$ depending on which side the input lies.
Using $-1$ as \texttt{false} and $+1$ as \texttt{true}, it is also possible to represent boolean functions such as \textit{AND}, \textit{OR}, \textit{NAND} and \textit{NOR}. However, some boolean functions, such as \textit{XOR} cannot be represented by a single perceptron \citep{ML}.

\todo{fix citation}
A schematic using the perceptron function is shown in Figure~\ref{fig:perceptron}.\\

    \label{fig:perceptron}
\end{figure}

For the definitions of the following activation functions, we will assume that $x$ is already the weighted sum of the input units.

\subsubsection{Sigmoid} % (fold)
\label{ssub:sigmoid}
A disadvantage of a perceptron is that it is not differentiable in the whole domain (specifically at $x=0$). Why this is a problem will become clear in Section~\ref{sub:gradient_descent_and_backpropagation}.\\
To solve this problem, a sigmoid function is used. A sigmoid function is a differentiable function that is monotonically increasing approaches an asymptote for $x \to \pm\infty$ \citep{series/lncs/LeCunBOM12}. As a result, these can still separate the input space in 2 parts.\\
In the artificial neural networks domain, the \textit{sigmoid function} generally refers to a variation of the logistic function and is denoted by $\sigma(x)$. Its formula is:
\begin{align}
    \begin{split}
        f(x) &= \sigma(x)\\
        &= \frac{1}{1+e^{-x}}
    \end{split}
\end{align}
The behavior of this function is visualized in Figure~\ref{fig:sigmoid}.
\begin{figure}[htb]

    \caption[The sigmoid function]{The sigmoid function.}
    \label{fig:sigmoid}
\end{figure}
% subsubsection sigmoid (end)

\subsubsection{Hyperbolic tangent} % (fold)
\label{ssub:hyperbolic_tangent}
Another popular function and another kind of sigmoid function is the hyperbolic tangent function, also called \textit{tanh}. While the output of the sigmoid function ranges between $0$ and $1$, here the output ranges between $-1$ and $+1$, just like the 2 possible values of the perceptron.
The formula of the hyperbolic tangent function, which can also be written in terms of the sigmoid function, is:
\begin{align}
    \begin{split}
        f(x) &= tanh(x)\\
        &= 2\sigma(2x) - 1\\
        &= \frac{e^{\frac{x}{2}} - e^{-\frac{x}{2}}}{e^{\frac{x}{2}} + e^{-\frac{x}{2}}}
    \end{split}
\end{align}
This function is visualized in Figure~\ref{fig:tanh}.
\begin{figure}[htb]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=.8\linewidth]{images/activation_functions/tanh.png}
    \caption{Hyperbolic tangent function.}
    \label{fig:tanh}
\end{figure}
% subsubsection hyperbolic_tangent (end)

\subsubsection{Rectified Linear Unit} % (fold)
\label{ssub:rectified_linear_unit}
A rectified linear unit, also called a ReLU, is another popular and more recent activation function. It was first defined by \cite{conf/icml/NairH10}. The output is the identity function if $x \ge 0$ and $0$ otherwise:
\begin{equation}
    f(x) = \begin{cases}
        x & \text{if $x \ge 0$}\\
        0 & \text{otherwise}
        \end{cases}
\end{equation}
As can be seen, this function requires less computations than the sigmoid and hyperbolic tangent function. However, the derivative for $x<0$ is always $0$. Why this can be a problem is explained in Section~\ref{sub:gradient_descent_and_backpropagation}.\\
The ReLU function is shown in Figure~\ref{fig:relu}.
\begin{figure}[htb]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=.8\linewidth]{images/activation_functions/relu.png}
    \caption[Rectified Linear Unit function]{Rectified Linear Unit function.}
    \label{fig:relu}
\end{figure}

To solve the problem of the derivative being zero at $x<0$, the Leaky ReLU was invented \citep{maas2013rectifier}. Here, instead of the output being zero for $x<0$, the output has a small slope, defined by a constant $\alpha$:
\begin{equation}
    f(x) = \begin{cases}
        x & \text{if $x \ge 0$}\\
        \alpha x & \text{otherwise}
        \end{cases}
\end{equation}
As can be seen, the derivative of this function is always non-zero.\\
An example of a Leaky ReLU is shown in Figure~\ref{fig:lrelu}.\\
\begin{figure}[htb]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=.8\linewidth]{images/activation_functions/lrelu.png}

    \label{fig:lrelu}
\end{figure}
% subsubsection rectified_linear_unit (end)
% subsection activation_functions (end)

A variation of a Leaky ReLU, called Parametric Rectified Unit, also has a small slope for $x<0$, but with an $\alpha$ that can be learned \citep{journals/corr/HeZR015}. Other variants use a random slope for values below zero \citep{journals/corr/XuWCL15}, add noise a ReLU \citep{conf/icml/NairH10} or use an exponential function for values below zero \citep{journals/corr/ClevertUH15}:
\begin{equation}
    f(x) = \begin{cases}
        x & \text{if $x \ge 0$}\\
        \alpha (e^x-1) & \text{otherwise}
        \end{cases}
\end{equation}

\subsection{Gradient descent and backpropagation} % (fold)
\label{sub:gradient_descent_and_backpropagation}
%Also something about linearly separable?
%Why no algebraic solution?
If we choose the weights of our network correctly, we might succeed in the approximating a function.
However, it is not always possible to separate the input space with our artificial neural network. In that case, we might want the best solution, e.g. one that has the least amount of errors in producing outputs w.r.t. the correct outputs, also called the target outputs. Furthermore, choosing the weights manually can be a tedious process.\\
For these reasons, we use an algorithm called called backpropagation, which uses a variation of gradient descent. We will first discuss gradient descent as this provides the basis of the backpropagation algorithm.

\subsubsection{Gradient descent} % (fold)
\label{ssub:gradient_descent}
In gradient descent, we search in the weight vector space, also called hypothesis space, to find weights that can approximate a function as best as possible. The tuple of the input and output of the target function is called a training example.

To be able to update weights, we first need to know how wrong our outputs were relative to those of our training examples.
This is called the training error and depends on the learning algorithm (in our case an artificial neural network), its parameters and the training examples. However, here we assume that the learning algorithm and the training examples are fixed while learning.
A common measure for the training error is:
\begin{equation}
    E(\overrightarrow{w}) \equiv \frac{1}{2} \sum_{i=0}^N (y_i - f(x_i;\overrightarrow{w}))^2
\end{equation}
Where $N$ is the number of training examples, $x_i$ is the input of a training example, $y_i$ is the target output of the training example and $f$ is our learning algorithm, which depends on the weight vector $\overrightarrow{w}$.

Because we now know how the training error and the weight vector is related, we can compute the derivative of the training error $E$ with respect to each component of $\overrightarrow{w}$. This called the gradient and is denoted as $\nabla E(\overrightarrow{w})$:
\begin{equation}
    \nabla E(\overrightarrow{w}) \equiv \big[ \frac{\partial E}{\partial w_0}, \frac{\partial E}{\partial w_1}, \dots, \frac{\partial E}{\partial w_n} \big]
\end{equation}
Where $n$ is the number of components in $\overrightarrow{w}$. Note $\nabla E(\overrightarrow{w})$ is also a vector. It defines how to change the weight components in order to get the steepest increase in the training error $E$. Thus, if we negate the gradient, we get the steepest decrease in $E$. Thus, we can update the weight vector as such:
\begin{equation}
    \overrightarrow{w} \gets \overrightarrow{w} - \eta \nabla E(\overrightarrow{w})
\end{equation}
Where $\eta$ is a positive value called the learning rate and influences how big the changes to the weight vector are.
\todo{Define (local) minimum. Also add figure?}
A small value leads to slow convergence, while a high value can cause the algorithm to overstep a local minimum. Because of this, the some algorithms gradually decrease the learning rate as the number of weight updates grows.\\
For a single weight component, we get:
\begin{equation}
    \label{eq:weightcomponentupdate}
    w_i \gets w_i - \eta \frac{\delta E}{\delta w_i}
\end{equation}

Of course, in order to update the weights, we first need to calculate the derivate of $E$ w.r.t. each component $w_i$. As an example, we show the derivative when using a simple linear unit, which defined as:
\begin{equation}
    f(\overrightarrow{x};\overrightarrow{w}) = \overrightarrow{x} \cdot \overrightarrow{w}
\end{equation}
We then get the following derivation:
\begin{align}
    \label{eq:gradderiv}
    \begin{split}
        \frac{\delta E}{\delta w_i} &= \frac{\delta}{\delta w_i} \frac{1}{2} \sum_{j=0}^N (y_j - f(\overrightarrow{x_j};\overrightarrow{w}))^2\\
        &= \frac{1}{2} \sum_{j=0}^N \frac{\delta}{\delta w_i} (y_j - f(\overrightarrow{x_j};\overrightarrow{w}))^2\\
        &= \frac{1}{2} \sum_{j=0}^N 2 (y_j - f(\overrightarrow{x_j};\overrightarrow{w})) \frac{\delta}{\delta w_i} (y_j - f(\overrightarrow{x_j};\overrightarrow{w}))\\
        &= \sum_{j=0}^N (y_j - f(\overrightarrow{x_j};\overrightarrow{w})) \frac{\delta}{\delta w_i} (y_i - \overrightarrow{x_i} \cdot \overrightarrow{w})\\
        &= \sum_{j=0}^N (y_j - f(\overrightarrow{x_j};\overrightarrow{w}))(-x_{ij})
    \end{split}
\end{align}
Where $x_{ij}$ is the $i$'th input component of training example $j$. We can then use the resulting formula of Equation~\ref{eq:gradderiv} along with Equation~\ref{eq:weightcomponentupdate} update each component of the weight vector:
\begin{equation}
    w_i \gets w_i + \eta \sum_{j=0}^N (y_i - f(\overrightarrow{x_j};\overrightarrow{w}))x_{ij}
\end{equation}
